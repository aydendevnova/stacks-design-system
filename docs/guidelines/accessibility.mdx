# Accessibility

Guidelines for building accessible Web3 applications with the Stacks Design System. All components are designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

:::info Why Accessibility Matters
Accessible applications reach more users, including those with disabilities. In Web3, where financial autonomy is a core principle, accessibility ensures everyone can participate in the decentralized economy.

## Color & Contrast

All color combinations in the Stacks Design System meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

### Testing Contrast

- Use browser dev tools to check contrast ratios
- Test with the Accessibility Insights extension
- Verify both light and dark modes
- Check focused states have sufficient contrast

### Color Independence

Never rely on color alone to convey information. Always pair color with text, icons, or patterns.

**Don't:** Use color-only indication (e.g., a green dot for success). This is not accessible to color-blind users.

**Do:** Use icon + text to provide clear feedback (e.g., "✓ Transaction Confirmed"). This communicates state regardless of color perception.

## Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements must be accessible via keyboard. Users should be able to navigate your entire application using only Tab, Enter, Space, and Arrow keys.

### Focus Management

- Focus states are visible on all interactive elements
- Focus order follows logical reading order
- Modal dialogs trap focus within the modal
- Focus returns to trigger element when modals close

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The design system components support these keyboard patterns:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Move to next interactive element |
| `Shift + Tab` | Move to previous interactive element |
| `Enter / Space` | Activate buttons, links, checkboxes |
| `Escape` | Close modals, menus, dropdowns |
| `Arrow Keys` | Navigate within menus, tabs, sliders |

## Screen Readers

Components include proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility.

### ARIA Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML elements where possible (`button`, `nav`, `main`)
- Add `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
- Use `aria-describedby` for form errors
- Mark decorative images with `aria-hidden="true"`
- Announce dynamic content with `aria-live` regions

### Web3-Specific Considerations

Blockchain applications have unique accessibility considerations:

- **Addresses:** Long addresses should be readable by screen readers. Consider adding a "copy address" button with clear labeling.
- **Transaction Status:** Use `aria-live` regions to announce transaction state changes (pending, confirmed, failed).
- **Numeric Values:** Ensure token amounts and prices are clearly labeled with their units.
- **Time-Sensitive Actions:** Provide adequate time for users to review transactions before signing.

## Motion & Animation

Respect user preferences for reduced motion. The design system automatically reduces animations when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- ✓ Navigate entire app using keyboard only
- ✓ Test with screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- ✓ Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1)
- ✓ Check focus indicators are visible
- ✓ Test with browser zoom at 200%
- ✓ Verify reduced motion is respected
- ✓ Check all images have alt text
- ✓ Ensure forms have proper labels
- ✓ Test transaction flows with assistive tech
