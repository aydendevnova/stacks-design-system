# Mobile Patterns

Guidelines for building mobile-first Web3 experiences. A significant portion of crypto users access applications on mobile devices.

:::info Mobile-First Approach
All components in the Stacks Design System are designed mobile-first, then enhanced for larger screens. This ensures great experiences across all devices.
:::

## Touch Targets

Ensure interactive elements are large enough for comfortable touch interaction. The minimum recommended touch target size is 44x44 pixels.

### Button Sizing

- **Mobile:** Use `size="lg"` (48px height) for primary actions
- **Desktop:** Default size (40px) works well with mouse interaction
- **Icon buttons:** Minimum 44x44px touch target area

```tsx
{/* Responsive button sizing */}
<Button size="lg" className="w-full md:w-auto md:size-default">
  Connect Wallet
</Button>
```

## Spacing & Layout

Increase spacing on mobile to prevent accidental taps and improve readability.

### Responsive Spacing

```tsx
{/* Mobile-first spacing */}
<div className="space-y-4 md:space-y-3">
  {/* More spacing on mobile, tighter on desktop */}
</div>

<div className="p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8">
  {/* Progressive padding increase */}
</div>
```

## Navigation Patterns

Mobile navigation requires different patterns than desktop.

### Bottom Navigation

For mobile apps, consider bottom navigation for frequently accessed areas. Keep it to 3-5 items maximum.

### Hamburger Menu

Use a hamburger menu for secondary navigation items. The sidebar component automatically collapses to a mobile drawer.

## Forms & Input

Optimize forms for mobile input:

- Use appropriate input types (`type="number"` for amounts)
- Stack form fields vertically on mobile
- Show clear error messages below inputs
- Use large, clearly labeled submit buttons

### Mobile-Optimized Form

```tsx
<form className="space-y-4">
  <Input
    label="Amount"
    type="number"
    inputMode="decimal"
    placeholder="0.00"
  />
  <Input
    label="Recipient"
    placeholder="SP..."
    autoComplete="off"
  />
  <Button size="lg" className="w-full">
    Continue
  </Button>
</form>
```

## Web3 Mobile Considerations

### Wallet Connection

Mobile wallet connection often involves deep links to wallet apps. Handle the full flow:

- Detect mobile browsers and show appropriate wallet options
- Use deep links to open wallet apps
- Handle return from wallet app gracefully
- Show clear loading states during connection

### Address Display

Stacks addresses are long. On mobile, truncate to show start and end:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Full address | `SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7` |
| Truncated | `SP2J6...9EJ7` |

### Transaction Confirmation

Transaction details must be clearly visible on small screens:

- Use a full-screen modal or sheet for transaction review
- Show key details prominently (amount, recipient, fees)
- Use large, clearly labeled action buttons
- Allow scrolling for detailed information

## Performance

Mobile devices often have limited bandwidth and processing power:

- Lazy load non-critical content
- Optimize images for mobile (WebP, appropriate sizes)
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Use skeleton loaders for perceived performance
- Cache API responses where appropriate

## Testing Checklist

- ✓ Test on real mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- ✓ Verify touch targets are at least 44x44px
- ✓ Check that forms work with mobile keyboards
- ✓ Test wallet connection flow on mobile
- ✓ Verify content is readable without zooming
- ✓ Test in both portrait and landscape orientations
- ✓ Check performance on slower connections (3G)
