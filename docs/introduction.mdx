# Introduction

Welcome to the Stacks Design System — a comprehensive toolkit for building Web3 applications on Stacks, the Bitcoin L2.

The Stacks Design System provides developers and designers with a collection of reusable components, patterns, and guidelines specifically crafted for building decentralized applications. Whether you're building a wallet, DEX, NFT marketplace, or any other Stacks application, this design system gives you the building blocks you need.

:::info For Developers & Designers
This documentation covers both the design principles and implementation details. Use the sidebar navigation to explore components, patterns, and guidelines.

## Design Principles

The Stacks Design System is built on four core principles that guide every decision we make:

### Web3-Native

Every component is designed with blockchain interactions in mind. From wallet connections to transaction confirmations, our patterns handle the unique challenges of crypto UX.

### Consistent & Cohesive

Built on a solid foundation of design tokens ensuring visual consistency across your entire application while allowing for customization.

### Mobile-First

All components are designed mobile-first and scale gracefully to larger screens. Perfect for users managing their assets on the go.

### Accessible

WCAG AA compliant with proper contrast ratios, focus states, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support built into every component.
